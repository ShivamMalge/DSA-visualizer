# DSA Visualizer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Polynomial Operations Visualizer**, developed as part of a college project. The application allows users to perform polynomial operations such as **addition and multiplication**, using both **array and linked list representations**. Additionally, users can **evaluate** the polynomial for a given value and visualize the results interactively.

## 🚀 Features
- **Polynomial Creation:** Users can specify the highest power and enter coefficients to create a polynomial.
- **Representation Selection:** Choose between **Array** and **Linked List** representation for storing and processing polynomials.
- **Operations:**
  - **Addition** of two polynomials.
  - **Multiplication** of two polynomials.
- **Evaluation:** Input a value for the polynomial variable and compute the result.
- **Data Visualization:** The results of operations and evaluations are displayed using interactive visualizations.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript(React JS)
- **Data Structures:** Linked List, Array
- **Visualization Library:** recharts form React

## 🎯 How to Use
1. **Create a Polynomial**: Enter the highest power and corresponding coefficients.
2. **Choose Representation**: Select **Array** or **Linked List**.
3. **Perform Operations**: Choose between **Addition** and **Multiplication**.
4. **Evaluate the Polynomial**: Input a value for the variable and get the computed result.
5. **Visualize Results**: The polynomial and its computed results are displayed graphically.


## 🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ShivamMalge/DSA-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd DSA-visualizer
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in a browser to start using the application.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- Implement polynomial **subtraction** operation.
- Add support for **division** of polynomials.
- Improve UI with better animations and themes.
- Optimize performance for handling large polynomials.
